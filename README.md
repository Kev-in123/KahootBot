# Kahoot
Add bots into a kahoot game that randomly selects answers  
requirements:\
**[python](https:\\www.python.org) and [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)**

Instructions
------------------------------------------  
   1.  Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   2.  Open cmd (command prompt) and type "pip install selenium" (Linux/MacOS users open your command line)
   3.  Download any code editor/IDE that can run python. I use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a [python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)  
   4.  Download [geckodriver (Mozilla Firefox)](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) (if you know how selenium works, you can download a different driver and edit the code correspondingly) and place it directly in the C:\ drive (WIndows). If you know how paths work, place it wherever you want and change the path. If you use Linux/MacOS you should know how to use paths on said OS
   5.  After you install a driver go download the files
   8.  Run the `main.py` file but specify the game pin. You don't need to specify name as a random one will be generated.

Notes
------------------------------------------  

 - You could open the file with a normal text editor, add the game pin and a optional name, and run the file from the command line.

 - When I say a random name, I mean something like '7RYuCoT'.

 - If you want to use a specific driver, you need the corresponding browser.


TODO
------------------------------------------

 - Make a better name generator
